            Walter Hartwell "Walt" White Sr., also known by his clandestine
            pseudonym "Heisenberg", is the main protagonist of Breaking Bad. He
            was a chemist and a former chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, New
            Mexico, who, after being diagnosed with Stage 3A inoperable lung
            cancer, started manufacturing crystal methamphetamine to both pay
            for his treatments and provide for his family in the event of his
            passing. He is the central character of the series, and is portrayed
            as a protagonist, antagonist and antihero. As the series progresses,
            Walter gradually becomes darker and takes on a more villainous role.
            Walt was once a promising chemist who, in graduate school,
            contributed research to a Nobel Prize-winning experiment. After
            graduate school, he co-founded the company Gray Matter Technologies
            with his friend Elliott Schwartz and his then-girlfriend Gretchen.
            Walt abruptly left the company and sold his financial interest for
            $5,000. Gretchen and Elliot later married and made a fortune. Walt
            resents Elliot and Gretchen for profiting from his work without
            crediting him.

          <p id="tribute-info">
            Knowing nothing about the drug trade, he enlists the aid of his
            former student, Jesse Pinkman, to manufacture and, more importantly,
            sell his meth. Walt's scientific knowledge and dedication to quality
            lead him to produce crystal meth of unrivaled purity. Walt
            eventually devised an alternative chemical process utilizing
            methylamine, giving his product a distinctive blue color. His
            crystal meth, christened "blue sky" by dealers and users alike,
            instantly began to dominate the market. While Walt was initially
            squeamish about the use of violence, he gradually came to see it as
            a necessity and eventually developed into a ruthless drug lord
            motivated largely by vanity, ego, and greed. Not only does Walt
            become more sinister throughout the series, but he rises in power.
            In Season 1, he and Jesse make thousands of dollars street dealing,
            but by Season 5, Walt is a millionaire drug lord that supplies
            crystal meth all across the South-West USA and as far as Eastern
            Europe. He achieved this by killing Gustavo Fring, establishing his
            own drug empire and then going into partnership with a neo-Nazi
            gang.

            "Heisenberg", the actual Werner Heisenberg from which he derived his
            criminal alias, was born on December 5, 1901, at Würzburg, and was a
            German theoretical physicist who made foundational contributions to
            quantum mechanics.
          </li>

            Walt's car was a well-used 2004 Pontiac Aztek that had been
            repainted in a non-factory color chosen by series creator Vince
            Gilligan, perhaps to mimic the look of a badly-faded factory paint
            job or as symbolic of Walt's previously bland existence.
          </li>
          <li>
            In addition to his chemistry expertise, Walter was shown to be a
            good mental calculator, as he calculated most of the numbers to his
            deals within his head and with no calculator.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bryan Cranston developed most of Walt's backstory, and also
            partially chose his attire. When he developed Walt's mustache, he
            said he wanted it to look like a dead mouse.
          </li>
          <li>
            Walt's doctor told him he may live two years in the best scenario:
            He lived almost two years after his diagnosis, missing the 2 year
            mark by a single day.
